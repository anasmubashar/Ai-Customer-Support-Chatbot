Question: Reverse a String
Answer: "hello"[::-1] results in "olleh"
Tip: Use slicing with [::-1] to reverse a string.

Question: Check for Palindrome
Answer: "racecar" == "racecar"[::-1] evaluates to True
Tip: Compare the string with its reverse.

Question: Find the Maximum Element in an Array
Answer: max([3, 5, 1, 9]) returns 9
Tip: Use the built-in max() function.

Question: Count the Occurrences of a Character in a String
Answer: "hello".count('l') returns 2
Tip: Use the count() method of strings.

Question: Sort an Array
Answer: [3, 1, 2].sort() results in [1, 2, 3]
Tip: Use sort() method or sorted() function.

Question: Find the Fibonacci Sequence
Answer: fibonacci(n) where fibonacci(5) returns 5
Tip: Use recursion or an iterative approach.

Question: Check for Prime Number
Answer: is_prime(7) returns True
Tip: Test divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Question: Find the Factorial of a Number
Answer: math.factorial(5) returns 120
Tip: Use recursion or math.factorial() function.

Question: Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Answer: merge([1, 3], [2, 4]) results in [1, 2, 3, 4]
Tip: Use two pointers to merge arrays.

Question: Remove Duplicates from a List
Answer: list(set([1, 2, 2, 3])) results in [1, 2, 3]
Tip: Convert the list to a set and back.

Question: Find the GCD of Two Numbers

Tip: Use dynamic programming.

Question: Calculate the Sum of Digits in a Number
Answer: sum(int(digit) for digit in str(123)) returns 6
Tip: Convert the number to a string and sum the digits.

Question: Implement Binary Search
Answer: For a sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and target 3, binary_search() returns 2
Tip: Divide the search interval in half.

Question: Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
Answer: Use Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm to determine if there is a cycle.
Tip: Use two pointers moving at different speeds.

Question: Rotate an Array
Answer: rotate([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) results in [3, 4, 1, 2]
Tip: Use slicing to rotate.

Question: Find the Missing Number in an Array of 1 to N
Answer: For [1, 2, 4] with N=4, the missing number is 3
Tip: Use the sum formula for first N natural numbers.

Question: Convert a String to Integer
Answer: int("123") returns 123
Tip: Use int() function for conversion.

Question: Implement a Stack Using Queues
Answer: Use two queues to simulate stack operations.
Tip: Use one queue to maintain the elements and the other for temporary storage.

Question: Find All Permutations of a String
Answer: For "abc", permutations are ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']
Tip: Use recursion or itertools.permutations().
